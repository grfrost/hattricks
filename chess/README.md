# How does this work ?

Basically A Negamax (vs MinMax) implementation using HAT to offload board generation and scoring to the GPU for each ply.

One kernel doMoves()
## GPU/HAT challenges.

### Today we have naming of the parts

I forgot that C99 (unlike Java) can't distinguish between function and var identifiers.

So 
```
var pieceValue = pieceValue(bits);
```
Would really confuse the OpenCL compiler :)   We might consider a '_fn_' prefix for all functions

### Prefix sum is 'integral' to many parallel solutions ;)

At present HAT does not provide a prefix sum, it should provide both exclusive and inclusive.

Possibly also integral image intrinsics.

> I am trying to implement minimax algorithm for a little chess game. Maybe my premise is wrong and this is not something that should be attempted. Is it?

> The program works but there is a big performance issue:

>> Depth = 0, 1 or 2 the result is immediate.
>> Depth = 3 the result takes 15 seconds.
>> Depth = 4 - haven't got a result yet.
